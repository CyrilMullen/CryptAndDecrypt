Sure, here's a draft for your README.md file:

```markdown
# CryptAndDecrypt

This repository contains a Python script for AES 256 encryption and decryption using the pycryptodome library.

## Description

The script provides two main functions: `encrypt` and `decrypt`. The `encrypt` function takes a plain text and a password, and returns a dictionary with the encrypted text. The `decrypt` function takes an encrypted dictionary and a password, and returns the decrypted text.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the pycryptodome library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

## Usage

Run the script in your terminal. You will be presented with a menu to choose from:

1. Encrypt information
2. Decrypt information
3. Quit

Enter your choice, and follow the prompts.

## Example

```python
python main.py
```
